## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

##### Working with APIs
In this project I learnt to work with APIs, integrating two APIs to work together to get information about an ip address or domain and display in a bar in the header and it's location on the map.


### Continued development

#### Creating partial overlap
In this project in the information section was position to sit perfectly in between two distinct section. I was able to resolve the issue in this solution but my implementation was not technically general and I would like to learn a more general solution to this problem.
